                My name is Edgar I have a job as a dev I still consider myself a novice in this field <br>
                but even so I give my best effort is my last year as a student in the umss and in cipec <br>
                I wanted to be a developer in frontend but many of the circumstances take me more to be <br>
                a backend developer  I can't complain little by little I also start to like it <br>
                even so I spend time practicing what a frontend developer does.

            I really do not have much else to tell I used to be a typical routine boy <br>
            someone really boring for many no parties or drinks and with friends that <br>
            you could count on your fingers I guess that like many this part had to be <br>
            broken by a girl and that it all started with a "I can sit here" I will <br>
            never forget those words I love her until today.

            His birthday is approaching, I am so anxious that he arrives, <br>
            I hope you like what I am doing, we have gone through many good and bad things <br>
            among them, mistakes and victories. Not long ago they asked me if I wanted to change <br>
            all those mistakes every time I think about it, now I tell myself that I do not If it <br>
            weren't for those mistakes, perhaps I would not have had the maturity that I have now, <br>
            I am very happy to have known her and lived so many things with her and today even <br>
            at a distance she continues to teach me many things haaa.
            </P>
